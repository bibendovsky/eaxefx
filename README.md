1 - Overview
============

The project enables EAX OpenAL Extension for systems without appropriate hardware.

OpenAL wrapper implements EAX calls with Effects Extension by using underlying OpenAL driver.


2 - Minimum requirements
========================

Operating system:
- Windows XP with Service Pack 3


3 - Patches
===========

Several runtime patches are embeded into the wrapper to fix EAX issues.

Separate application `eaxefx_app_patcher.exe` is available for offline patching.

Resolved issues:
- Doom 3 (2004) [visual twitch bug](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Doom_3#Visual_twitch_bug_with_OpenAL.2FEAX).
- Quake 4 (2005) source occlusion out of range.
- Prey (2006) source occlusion out of range.  
  Only runtime patching is supported for Steam version.


4 - Supported drivers
=====================

- [OpenAL Soft](https://openal-soft.org)

Notes:
- Driver is not included into release package.


5 - Driver file name convention
===============================

The driver should be named with one of the following names:
- `eaxefx_driver.dll`
- `dsoal-aldrv.dll`
- `soft_oal.dll`

The wrapper tries to load a driver in the order specified above.


6 - Missing features
====================


6.1 - Bypassed features
=======================

Context:
- HF Reference (EAX 4.0/5.0)
- Macro FX Factor (EAX 5.0)
- Speaker configuration (EAX 5.0)
- X-RAM

Source:
- Speaker levels (EAX 5.0)


7 - Known issues
================

- OpenAL Soft official binaries v1.20.x may cause a crash upon exiting the application.


8 - Usage
=========

Terminology:
- `DIR` - the directory with application's main executable.

Steps:
1. Backup (if necessary) `OpenAL32.dll` in the `DIR`.
2. Extract the release package into some directory.
3. Copy extracted `OpenAL32.dll` into the `DIR`.
4. Put properly named driver into the `DIR`.
5. Enable appropriate EAX options in the application and restart it if necessary.


9 - Log file
============

The wrapper creates a log file (`eaxefx_log.txt`) in the working directory, set by the application.
Usually it's identical to the directory where the wrapper is placed.

If the working directory or the log file itself is write-protected the logger tries to create the log in the default application data directory.

On Windows it's `%APPDATA%\bibendovsky\eaxefx` (e.g., `C:\users\john\AppData\Roaming\bibendovsky\eaxefx`).


10 - Compiling requirements
==========================

Common:
- Windows 32/64-bit build target.

Minimum:
- CMake v3.8.2
- C++17 compatible compiler.


11 - FAQ
========

Q: There is a subtle difference in audio when using the wrapper.

A: Search driver's documentation about amplifying EAX properties.  
In case of OpenAL Soft it's [`boost` option in `reverb` section](https://github.com/kcat/openal-soft/blob/master/alsoftrc.sample).  
Example of `alsoft.ini`:
```
[reverb]
boost = 8
```
